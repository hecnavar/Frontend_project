# Frontend_project
This repository is the combination of what I learned in the last 9 weeks practicing with HTML, CSS, SASS, using frameworks like bootstrap among other things, where it is summarized in a few pages on how to use these tools, so as not to forget what I learned and it is easy to remember. and relearn if necessary
